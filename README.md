this fork is simply to 'hot-fix' a problem where you can't access font data when extracting text, it's probably not safe nor is it properly tested. 
the TestExtraction1 test breaks because honestly i'm too lazy to fix it
also i might have accidentally formatted pdfpage-textextraction.cpp when adding my fix
